# NLP Specialization: Coursera Assignments

Hi there! This repository contains all my assignments and projects from the [NLP Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/natural-language-processing) on Coursera. You'll find:
- **Week-by-Week Progress:** Each folder represents a week of the course, neatly packed with code, comments, and insights, and sometimes links to detailed explanations on my Medium account.
- **Twists and Turns:** Expect some creative spins and additional features added to the assignments – because why stick to the script?

I really hope you’ll find the code insightful, the comments helpful, and the journey inspiring.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python 
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib 
- TensorFlow, PyTorch
- NLTK, spaCy, Hugging Face 

## Contribute
Found a better solution? Got some feedback? Feel free to open a pull request or start a discussion. Let’s make this a collaborative learning experience!

## Note :)
This repo is a work in progress. I’ll be updating it regularly as I complete more assignments.
